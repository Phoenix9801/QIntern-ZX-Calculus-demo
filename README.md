# ZX-Calculus-demo
This is an attempt to provide an online as well as an application platform for everyone who is interested and is willing to start and enter the world of **Quantum Computing**. *ZX Calculus* is the main topic and an extremely newer branch of Quantum Computing, *ZX Calculus* is a graphical language that is used to solve higher order Quantum Circuits with a maximum efficiency and making the tedious and critical job extremely simple. 

## *ZX CALCULUS*
We have provided an oriented study material with detailed mathematical and theoretical model of the application of the ZX Calculus. We have devided the contents in 3 modes focusing on the contents and the codes. We are going to use PyZX to program the codes for ZX Calculus.
