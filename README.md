# ZX-Calculus-demo
This is an attempt to provide an online as well as an application platform for everyone who is interested and is willing to start and enter the world of **Quantum Computing**. *ZX Calculus* is the main topic and an extremely newer branch of Quantum Computing, *ZX Calculus* is a graphical language that is used to solve higher order Quantum Circuits with a maximum efficiency and making the tedious and critical job extremely simple. 

## *ZX CALCULUS*
We have provided an oriented study material with detailed mathematical and theoretical model of the application of the ZX Calculus. We have devided the contents in 2 modes focusing on the Chapters where the theoretical and mathematical models of **Quantum Computing Using ZX Calculus** is explained and second where the codes for the same are explained in a self explainatory Jupyter Notebook. We are going to use PyZX to program the codes for ZX Calculus. 

### *Context*
You can visit our [Git Hub Page](https://github.com/Phoenix9801/QIntern-ZX-Calculus-demo) for an organised view.
The contents listed and that would be covered are -
1. [Chapters](https://github.com/Phoenix9801/QIntern-ZX-Calculus-demo/tree/main/Chapters) explaining the theoretical and mathematical models.
2. [Codes](https://github.com/Phoenix9801/QIntern-ZX-Calculus-demo/tree/main/Codes) codes for the same exercises are mentioned.
